## Description 

This project was built as a simple 5 questions game. The app utilizes local storage and JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML elements on the page. The highscores will be locally saved and updated after every quiz attempt.

## Testing

There are explainations on the landing page. You have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. There is no winning score, try to get as many correct as possible, then input your name and save your high score. You can view your highscores by selecting the highscores links. If you answer a question wrong you will be deducted 10 seconds off the clock so be careful.

## Unique Feature

I feel a unique feature added to this site is the timer. After 30 seconds it will change it color to red to indicate time is running short. Once it reaches 15 seconds it will start to blink in an attempt to grab the users attention to the amount of time remaining. Please check this feature out.

## Credits

Credits go to W3 schools for clearing up any JavaScript questions I had
